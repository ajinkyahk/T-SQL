**************************  Cascading referential integrity constraint - Part 5    **************************


* Cascading referential integrity constraint allows to define the actions MicrosoftSQL Server should take when a user attempts to delete or update
   a key to which an existing foreign keys points.

* For example, If you delete row with ID=1 from tblGender table, then row with ID=3 from tblPerson table becomes an orphan record. You will not be able
   to tell the Gender for this row. 
   So, Cascading referential integrity constraint can be used to define actions MicrosoftSQL Server should take when this happens.
   By default, we get an error and the DELETE or UPDATE statement is rolled back.

==========================================================================================================================

Delete from tblGender where ID = 2

SSMS Not allow:-	The DELETE statement conflicted with the REFERENCE constraint "tblPerson_GenderID_FK". 
		The conflict occurred in database "sample", table "dbo.tblPerson", column 'GenderID'.
		The statement has been terminated.

* Options when setting up Cascading referential integrity constraint:

1. No Action : This is the default behaviour. 
    No Action specifies that if an attempt is made to delete or update a row with a key referenced by foreign keys in existing rowsin other tables, an error is raised
    and the DELETE or UPDATE is rolled back.

2. Cascade : Specifies that if an attempt is made to delete or update a row with a key referenced by foreign keys in an existing rows in other tables, 
    all rows containing those foreign keys are also deleted or updated.

3. Set NULL : Specifies that if an attempt is made to delete or update a row with a key referenced by foreign keys in existing rows in other tables, 
    all rows containg containg those foreign keys are set to NULL

4. Set Defult: Specifies that if an attempt is made to delete or update a row with a key referenced by foreign keys in existing rows in other tables,
    all rows containg those foreign keys are set to default values.
